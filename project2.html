    <h1>Hello World
     </hr>
     <h2> A Place I would like to visit
        <p> I would like to visit Germany, because my family comes from there. I also think that it would be cool to see all the castles
          and historic places. The food would also be a deciding factor, typical German food is spatizl, sourkraut, and brotwursts.

          <h2> A person I admire <br> (past or present)
            <p> I admire President George Washington becuase he could have been the king of America but he chose not to be.
